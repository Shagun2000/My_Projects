The Titanic project involves predicting the survival of passengers aboard the famous RMS Titanic using machine learning algorithms like K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Logistic Regression. The goal is to analyze the dataset and build models to determine the factors that influenced passenger survival.

This dataset contains information about passengers, such as age, gender, ticket class, and cabin location. It includes a binary target variable "Survived" indicating whether a passenger survived (1) or not (0).

How to Use:
	Perform data exploration and visualization to understand the dataset.
	Preprocess the data by handling missing values, converting categorical features, and scaling numerical data.
	Split the dataset into training and testing sets for model evaluation.
	Apply KNN and Logistic Regression algorithms to build predictive models.
	Evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
	Use the models to predict survival for new passenger data.
